# Measuring Reproduciblity of Machine Learning Methods for Medical Diagnosis

**Abstract:** The National Academy of Sciences, Engineering,
and Medicine (NASEM) defines reproducibility as “obtaining
consistent computational results using the same input data,
computational steps, methods, code, and conditions of analysis,”
and replicability as “obtaining consistent results across studies
aimed at answering the same scientific question, each of which
has obtained its own data” [1]. Due to an increasing number
of applications of artificial intelligence and machine learning
(AI/ML) to fields such as healthcare and digital medicine, there
is a growing need for verifiable AI/ML results, and therefore
reproducible research and replicable experiments. This paper
establishes examples of irreproducible AI/ML applications to
medical sciences and quantifies the variance of common AI/ML
models (neural network, na ̈ıve Bayes classifier, and random forest
classifiers) for tasks on medical data sets.
